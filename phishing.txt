Phishing is when attackers send malicious emails designed to trick people into falling for a scam. 
The intent is often to get users to reveal financial information, system credentials or other sensitive data.
Phishing is an example of social engineering: a collection of techniques that scam artists use to manipulate human psychology.
 Social engineering techniques include forgery, misdirection and lyingâ€”all of which can play a part in phishing attacks.
